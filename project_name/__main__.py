    The main function executes on commands:
    `python -m project_name` and `$ project_name `.

    This is your program's entry point.

    You can change this function to do whatever you want.
    Examples:
        * Run a test suite
        * Run a server
        * Do some other stuff
        * Run a command line application (Click, Typer, ArgParse)
        * List all available tasks
        * Run an application (Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.)
